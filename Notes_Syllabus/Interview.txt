I've learned this concept before from the React docs and it's called state as a snapshot.
  When we write setCounter(counter+1) multiple times it is updated only once because in the 
  onclick handler of that render, even after calling setCounter(counter + 1) multiple times
   the value of the counter is 15, because after our event handler finishes, then React re-renders 
   the component  

 PROBLEM - he reason why the first code didn't work as aspected is because if there are multiple 
 setstate then react will batch this updates and que them first,
 then process it accordingly and react will update all the values in the next render.The reason 
 react does this is for performance optimization because if our component renders after each update 
 then it's not really good performance wise so react will batch these updates and just perform one render.
