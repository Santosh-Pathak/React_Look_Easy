React Fiber is like a new and improved engine for React, 
the popular JavaScript library. It's built to make things like animations and layouts smoother. 
The standout feature is that it can break down tasks into smaller pieces and work on them bit by bit,
 making things feel faster.
It also has some handy abilities like pausing or stopping tasks and deciding which tasks are more important.
In simple terms, it's like giving React a turbo boost for better performance, especially when dealing with dynamic 
and interactive elements on a website.



Reconciliation in React is like a smart process that figures out what parts of a webpage need to change when you update your app. 
When you make a change (like clicking a button), React doesn't redo everything from scratchâ€”it calculates the most efficient way to update
only the necessary parts, making your app work fast and smoothly. This clever process is what people often refer to as the "virtual DOM."
So, reconciliation is like React's behind-the-scenes worker that keeps your app looking fresh without wasting resources.
